## Manual Testing Workflow

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens at: http://localhost:5173/

### 2. Test Enhanced Timeline Component
Navigate to: **http://localhost:5173/event/sample**

#### Core Functionality Tests:
- [ ] **Heat Mapping**: Different colors for different attendee counts (0-5 people)
- [ ] **Drag Selection**: Click and drag to select multiple time slots
- [ ] **Drag Deselection**: Drag over selected slots to deselect them
- [ ] **Real-time Feedback**: Count and colors update immediately when selecting
- [ ] **Smart Submit Button**: Only enabled when name + time slots selected
- [ ] **Best Times Display**: Shows time ranges above Current Responses

#### Mobile Testing (resize browser to test):
- [ ] **320px width**: All interactions work with simulated finger touches
- [ ] **375px width**: Text readable, touch targets adequate (48px minimum)
- [ ] **768px width**: Layout transitions smoothly to tablet view
- [ ] **Touch interactions**: All drag and selection work on mobile

#### Accessibility Testing:
- [ ] **Colorblind Toggle**: Click accessibility icon to test pattern overlay
- [ ] **Color Contrast**: All text readable on colored backgrounds
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through interface, all interactive elements reachable
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Alt text and ARIA labels present

### 3. Test Core App Navigation
- [ ] **Home page** (/) loads with proper styling and navigation
- [ ] **Create page** (/create) form works and validation functions
- [ ] **About page** (/about) loads with project information
- [ ] **Header navigation** functions correctly between all pages
- [ ] **Responsive design** works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] **No console errors** in browser developer tools

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] **Page load**: Initial load under 2 seconds
- [ ] **Interaction responsiveness**: Drag selection feels smooth
- [ ] **Bundle size**: Check Network tab - should be ~420KB total
- [ ] **Memory usage**: No obvious memory leaks during extended use

### 5. Cross-browser Testing (if available)
- [ ] **Chrome/Edge**: Full functionality
- [ ] **Firefox**: Full functionality  
- [ ] **Safari**: Full functionality (especially mobile Safari)
