# Real-Time Preview Updates Implementation Plan
**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**PR:** pr-004-ui-ux-refinements  
**Branch:** pr-004-ui-ux-refinements

## Overview
Implement real-time updates to the "Best Times" and "Current Responses" sections that reflect user's availability selections as they interact with the timeline, providing immediate visual feedback before they submit their response.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Behavior
- **Best Times**: Shows static analysis based only on existing submitted responses
- **Current Responses**: Displays only submitted participant data
- **User Experience**: No preview of how their selections would affect the overall results
- **Feedback Delay**: Users must submit to see impact of their availability choices

### User Experience Goals
- **Immediate Feedback**: Show how user's selections affect best times in real-time
- **Preview Mode**: Display user's potential contribution before submission
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear indication between submitted vs. preview data
- **Smooth Interactions**: Updates as user drags, clicks, or modifies selections

## Technical Analysis

### Current Data Flow
```
Existing Responses → Best Times Algorithm → Display
                 → Current Responses → Display
```

### Proposed Data Flow
```
Existing Responses + User Preview → Real-time Best Times → Display with Preview Indicator
                                 → Current Responses → Display with Preview Entry
```

### Key Components to Modify
1. **Best Times Algorithm** (`src/utils/timeRangeAnalysis.ts`)
2. **Event Page Component** (`src/pages/Event.tsx`)
3. **Timeline Component** (`src/components/availability/EnhancedTimelineLayout.tsx`)
4. **Best Times Display Component** (to be identified/created)
5. **Current Responses Display Component** (to be identified/created)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Structure Enhancement (45 min)
**Goal**: Extend data structures to support preview states

**Tasks**:
1. **Extend Response Types** to include preview/temporary status
   ```typescript
   interface EventResponse {
     name: string
     availability: string[]
     isPreview?: boolean
     isTemporary?: boolean
     timestamp?: Date
   }
   ```

2. **Create Preview Response Generator**
   ```typescript
   const generatePreviewResponse = (name: string, selections: string[]): EventResponse => ({
     name: name || 'You (Preview)',
     availability: selections,
     isPreview: true,
     isTemporary: true,
     timestamp: new Date()
   })
   ```

3. **Enhance Best Times Algorithm** to accept preview responses
   - Add optional parameter for preview data
   - Maintain separate calculation paths for submitted vs. preview
   - Return metadata about preview impact

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/types/event.ts` - Extend EventResponse interface
- `src/utils/timeRangeAnalysis.ts` - Enhance algorithm for preview support

### Phase 2: Real-Time Best Times Updates (60 min)
**Goal**: Update Best Times section to reflect user's current selections

**Tasks**:
1. **Create Enhanced Best Times Calculator**
   ```typescript
   const calculateBestTimesWithPreview = (
     responses: EventResponse[],
     previewSelections: string[],
     userName: string
   ) => {
     const previewResponse = generatePreviewResponse(userName, previewSelections)
     const allResponses = [...responses, previewResponse]
     return analyzeBestTimes(allResponses, { includePreview: true })
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Real-Time Updates**
   - Listen to timeline selection changes
   - Recalculate best times on every selection change
   - Debounce calculations for performance (250ms delay)
   - Show loading states during calculations

3. **Visual Preview Indicators**
   - Add "(Preview)" labels to affected time ranges
   - Use different colors/styles for preview vs. confirmed times
   - Show delta indicators (↑ +2 people, ↓ -1 person)

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Use React.useMemo for best times computation
   - Implement incremental updates where possible

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/utils/timeRangeAnalysis.ts` - Enhanced best times calculation
- `src/pages/Event.tsx` - Real-time calculation integration
- Components displaying Best Times section

### Phase 3: Real-Time Current Responses Updates (45 min)
**Goal**: Show user's preview entry in Current Responses section

**Tasks**:
1. **Preview Response Display**
   ```typescript
   const PreviewResponse = ({ name, selectionCount, isActive }) => (
     <div className="preview-response">
       <Group>
         <Text>{name} (Preview)</Text>
         <Badge variant="outline" color="orange">Live Preview</Badge>
       </Group>
       <Text size="sm" c="dimmed">
         {selectionCount} time slots selected
       </Text>
     </div>
   )
   ```

2. **Dynamic Response List**
   - Add preview response to current responses display
   - Sort preview response (typically at top or bottom)
   - Show real-time count updates as user selects/deselects
   - Animate changes for smooth UX

3. **Visual Distinction**
   - Different styling for preview vs. submitted responses
   - Subtle animation/pulsing for active preview
   - Clear "Preview" labels and badges

**Files to Modify**:
- Components displaying Current Responses
- `src/pages/Event.tsx` - State management for preview responses

### Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience (30 min)
**Goal**: Polish the real-time preview experience

**Tasks**:
1. **Smooth Animations**
   - Fade in/out for preview elements
   - Number counting animations for selection counts
   - Smooth transitions for best times changes

2. **User Feedback**
   - Subtle vibration/haptic feedback on mobile
   - Visual highlights for affected time ranges
   - Toast notifications for significant changes

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track calculation performance
   - Implement fallback for slow devices
   - Add loading states for complex calculations

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Screen reader announcements for preview changes
   - Keyboard navigation for preview states
   - Clear labeling of preview vs. final data

**Files to Modify**:
- All components with animation/feedback features
- Accessibility enhancement across preview components

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Strategy
```typescript
// Event page state enhancement
const [userSelections, setUserSelections] = useState<string[]>([])
const [userName, setUserName] = useState<string>('')
const [previewMode, setPreviewMode] = useState<boolean>(true)

// Real-time calculations
const bestTimesWithPreview = useMemo(() => {
  if (!previewMode || userSelections.length === 0) {
    return originalBestTimes
  }
  return calculateBestTimesWithPreview(responses, userSelections, userName)
}, [responses, userSelections, userName, previewMode])
```

### Performance Considerations
```typescript
// Debounced calculations
const debouncedCalculation = useDebouncedCallback(
  (selections: string[]) => {
    calculateBestTimesWithPreview(responses, selections, userName)
  },
  250 // 250ms delay
)

// Memoized expensive operations
const memoizedBestTimes = useMemo(() => 
  calculateBestTimes(allResponses), 
  [allResponses]
)
```

### Visual Design Patterns
```typescript
// Preview styling
const previewStyles = {
  opacity: 0.8,
  border: '2px dashed var(--mantine-color-orange-4)',
  background: 'var(--mantine-color-orange-0)'
}

// Animation configurations
const previewAnimation = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
  animate: { opacity: 1, scale: 1 },
  exit: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 },
  transition: { duration: 0.2 }
}
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Real-Time Update Flow
```
User Timeline Interaction
    ↓
Selection State Update (userSelections)
    ↓
Debounced Calculation Trigger (250ms)
    ↓
Best Times Recalculation (with preview)
    ↓
Current Responses Update (add preview)
    ↓
UI Components Re-render
    ↓
Visual Feedback Display
```

### Component Communication
```
Event.tsx (Parent)
    ├── Timeline Component (sends selection updates)
    ├── Best Times Component (receives preview calculations)
    └── Current Responses Component (receives preview response)
```

## User Experience Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time Selection
1. User clicks first time slot
2. Preview response appears in Current Responses: "You (Preview) - 1 time slot selected"
3. Best Times recalculates and shows preview impact
4. Visual indicators show this is preview data

### Scenario 2: Drag Selection
1. User drags across multiple time slots
2. Real-time count updates in Current Responses
3. Best Times updates continuously during drag
4. Smooth animations for number changes

### Scenario 3: Name Entry
1. User enters their name in form field
2. Preview response immediately updates from "You (Preview)" to "[Name] (Preview)"
3. All preview elements reflect the entered name

### Scenario 4: Selection Removal
1. User deselects time slots
2. Preview count decreases in real-time
3. Best Times recalculates showing reduced availability
4. If all selections removed, preview response disappears gracefully
