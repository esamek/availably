# Server Coordination System Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the parallel subagent server coordination system implemented in the Availably project.

## Test Categories

### 1. **Unit Tests** (Individual Component Testing)
Test each coordination component in isolation to ensure basic functionality.

### 2. **Integration Tests** (Component Interaction Testing)
Test how different coordination components work together.

### 3. **Concurrency Tests** (Parallel Access Testing)
Test the system under concurrent access scenarios that mirror real parallel subagent usage.

### 4. **Failure Recovery Tests** (Error Handling Testing)
Test system behavior under various failure conditions.

### 5. **Performance Tests** (Load and Timing Testing)
Test system performance under realistic and stress conditions.

```

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
1. **Create test framework** (`test-coordination.sh`)
2. **Set up test environment** (isolated temp directories)
3. **Implement test utilities** (mock processes, timing functions)
4. **Create test data generators** (multiple agent scenarios)

### Phase 2: Automated Test Suite
1. **Unit test automation** (individual component tests)
2. **Integration test automation** (component interaction tests)
3. **Concurrency test framework** (parallel execution management)
4. **Test reporting system** (results aggregation and analysis)

### Phase 3: Manual Test Scenarios
1. **Real-world simulation** (actual parallel subagent workflows)
2. **Edge case exploration** (unusual but possible scenarios)
3. **User experience testing** (ease of use, error messages)
4. **Documentation validation** (test instructions and examples)

## Test Environment Requirements

### System Requirements
- Unix-like environment (macOS/Linux)
- Bash shell with standard utilities
- Process management capabilities (`kill`, `pgrep`, etc.)
- Network connectivity for server testing
- Temporary file system access

### Test Isolation
- Each test runs in isolated temporary directories
- No interference between concurrent test runs
- Clean state before and after each test
- Proper cleanup of test artifacts

## Test Data and Scenarios

### Mock Agent Profiles
```bash
# Agent A: UI Polish (quick tasks, frequent start/stop)
# Agent B: Algorithm Development (long-running, intensive)
# Agent C: Real-time Features (medium duration, server-dependent)
# Agent D: Interaction Enhancement (sporadic, testing-focused)
```

### Test Scenarios
```bash
# Scenario 1: Sequential Development
# Agents work one after another (common for single developer)

# Scenario 2: Parallel Development
# Multiple agents working simultaneously (team development)

# Scenario 3: Handoff Development
# Agents pass work between each other (code review, debugging)

# Scenario 4: Emergency Scenarios
# Forced shutdowns, process crashes, system recovery
```

- Multiple test runs for concurrency tests
- Controlled failure injection mechanisms
- Performance testing in isolated environments
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Review this test plan** with stakeholders
2. **Assign test implementation** to subagents
3. **Set up test infrastructure** (Phase 1)
4. **Implement automated tests** (Phase 2)
5. **Execute manual scenarios** (Phase 3)
6. **Analyze results** and improve system
7. **Document findings** and update coordination system

This comprehensive test plan ensures the server coordination system is robust, reliable, and ready for production use with parallel subagents.
