# Availably Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary
Build a frictionless group scheduling webapp using React + Vite + Mantine UI components, hosted on Vercel with Supabase for data persistence. Focus on zero-login experience with shareable links for event coordination.

## Current State Analysis
- ✅ Requirements defined in APP_REQUIREMENTS.md
- ✅ Tech stack selected (React/Vite/Mantine/Supabase/Vercel)
- ✅ Sitemap planned (4 main pages)
- ⏳ No code exists yet - starting from scratch

## Required Changes

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Initialize React + Vite project with TypeScript
2. Configure Mantine UI component library
3. Set up basic routing (React Router)
4. Create project structure and initial pages

### Phase 2: Data Layer
1. Set up Supabase project and database schema
2. Create data models for events and responses
3. Implement API functions for CRUD operations
4. Add real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Phase 3: Core Features
1. Event creation form with date/time selection
2. Event response page with availability grid
3. Participant management (name entry, response editing)
4. Visual availability aggregation and display

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy
1. Mobile-responsive design optimization
2. Error handling and loading states
3. Performance optimization
4. Vercel deployment setup

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Project Initialization ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Run `claude init` to setup Claude Code in directory
- [x] Create React + Vite project: `npm create vite@latest availably -- --template react-ts`
- [x] Install dependencies: Mantine, React Router, date utilities
- [x] Configure basic project structure and routing

### Step 2: UI Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Set up Mantine theme and providers
- [x] Create basic page components (Home, Create, Event, About)
- [x] Implement responsive layout with navigation
- [x] Add basic styling and component structure
- [x] Enhanced with interactive demo content and sample event

### Step 3: Database Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project and get connection credentials
- [ ] Design database schema (events table, responses table)
- [ ] Set up Supabase client and environment variables
- [ ] Create database helper functions

### Step 4: Event Creation Flow
- [ ] Build event creation form with validation
- [ ] Implement date/time selection interface
- [ ] Add event persistence to Supabase
- [ ] Generate shareable event URLs

### Step 5: Event Response Flow
- [ ] Create event display page showing details
- [ ] Build availability grid/calendar interface
- [ ] Implement participant response submission
- [ ] Add real-time updates for new responses

### Step 6: Data Visualization
- [ ] Create availability aggregation logic
- [ ] Build visual grid showing overlapping availability
- [ ] Add summary of best meeting times
- [ ] Implement response editing for participants

### Step 7: Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Optimize for mobile devices
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment configuration
- [ ] Configure custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Add basic analytics (optional)

## Database Schema Design

### Events Table
```sql
events (
  id: uuid (primary key)
  name: text (required)
  description: text (optional)
  location: text (optional)
  duration: interval (optional)
  possible_dates: jsonb (array of date objects)
  possible_times: jsonb (array of time ranges)
  created_at: timestamp
  expires_at: timestamp (auto-cleanup)
)
```

### Responses Table
```sql
responses (
  id: uuid (primary key)
  event_id: uuid (foreign key to events)
  participant_name: text (required)
  availability: jsonb (selected date/time combinations)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
)
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Event creation takes < 30 seconds
- [ ] Participant response takes < 60 seconds
- [ ] Real-time updates work across multiple browsers
- [ ] Mobile experience is fully functional
- [ ] Application loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Zero-cost hosting achieved on free tiers

## Technical Considerations
- Use React Context for global state management
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Add proper TypeScript types for all data structures
- Use Mantine's date picker components for time selection
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- Add basic SEO meta tags for link sharing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Supabase limits**: Monitor usage and have backup plan (Vercel KV)
- **Real-time complexity**: Start with polling, upgrade to websockets if needed
- **Mobile performance**: Test on actual devices, optimize bundle size
- **Data persistence**: Implement local storage backup for responses

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Natural language availability input
- Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
- Email notifications for responses
- Anonymous participation mode
- Recurring event templates
