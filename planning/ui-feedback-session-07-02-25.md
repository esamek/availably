## Session Overview
Date: 2025-07-01
Purpose: Gather user feedback on each screen of the Availably app to plan UI improvements

## Screens to Review
- [ ] Home page (/)
- [ ] Create event page (/create)
- [ ] Event response page (/event/sample)
- [ ] About page (/about)
- [ ] Navigation/Header

## Feedback Collection

### Home Page (/)
**Current Status:** âœ… Reviewed
**User Feedback:** Fine for the moment
**Improvement Ideas:**
- No immediate changes needed
**Priority:** Low 

---

### Create Event Page (/create)
**Current Status:** âœ… Reviewed
**User Feedback:** 
- Remove "available features" section - it's strange and unnecessary
- Demo event area is confusing - should it only show in development? If always there, make it less prominent (simple button instead of full card)
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Remove available features display from create page
- Make demo event area less prominent (simple text link or small button instead of full card)
**Priority:** High 

---

### Event Response Page (/event/sample)
**Current Status:** âœ… Reviewed
**User Feedback:** 
- Hardcoded description "Let's find a good time..." should be editable by event creator
- Try alternatives to checkbox-based availability selection
- Need visual representation of current responses and best times
- Available times should be 15-minute increments respecting creator's date/time ranges
- Show available time ranges visually so users understand coordinator's constraints
- Build all alternatives in single page with clear option marking
- Layout alternatives should explore different space allocation (form vs responses/availability)
- Want one alternative that's data visualization driven
- Can import other libraries/tools for design experimentation
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Add event description field to creation flow
- Design 4 alternative layouts with different interaction patterns (non-checkbox)
- Implement visual data representation of responses and availability
- Create 15-minute increment time selection
- Add visual display of coordinator's set time ranges
- Build comparison page showing all layout options
- Include data visualization approach using external libraries
**Priority:** High

### About Page (/about)
**Current Status:** âœ… Reviewed
**User Feedback:** Fine for now
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Future improvements to consider
**Priority:** Low 

---

### Navigation/Header
**Current Status:** âœ… Reviewed
**User Feedback:** Fine except unclear how to get home from about page
**Improvement Ideas:**
- Improve navigation from about page back to home
**Priority:** Medium
